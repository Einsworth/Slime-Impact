# Slime-Impact
Final project of CPE101 (Engineering Exploration).

# Description
Slime Impact is inspired by Ant Smasher, using Unity to develop. It's a singleplayer game where you have to tap slime and fight a boss to win!

# Note
This is unrefined version which code is not commented and the build didn't use some asset.
